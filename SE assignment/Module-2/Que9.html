                            <p class="p1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.G.F:_Chapter_2"> K.G.F: Chapter 2</a> is a 2022 Indian Kannada-language period action film written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale Films. The second instalment in a two-part series, it serves as a sequel to the 2018 film K.G.F: Chapter 1. The film stars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_(actor)">Yash,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Dutt"> Sanjay Dutt,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raveena_Tandon"> Raveena Tandon,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinidhi_Shetty"> Srinidhi Shetty</a>

                                t follows the assassin Rocky, who after establishing himself as the kingpin of the Kolar Gold Fields, 
                                must retain his supremacy over adversaries and government officials, while also coming to terms with his past.</p>

                            <p class="p2">Produced on a budget of ₹100 crore, K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the most expensive Kannada film ever made. 
                                Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the film score and songs. 
                                Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early 2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot back-to-back with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.G.F:_Chapter_1"> Chapter 1.</a>
                                 Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in February 2020 owing to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later and was completed in December 2020. 
                                 Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar.</p>

                            <p class="p3">K.G.F: Chapter 2 was theatrically released in India on 14 April 2022 in Kannada, 
                                along with dubbed versions in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam languages. 
                                It is also the first Kannada film to release in IMAX. The film received mixed reviews from critics. 
                                Neel's direction, the action sequences, cinematography and performances (particularly Yash) received praise,
                                but the pace and writing attracted criticism. Besides this, it recorded the second highest-opening day in India, 
                                the film set domestic opening day records in Kannada, Hindi and Malayalam, and surpassed the lifetime gross of its predecessor in two days to become the highest-grossing Kannada film. 
                                With earnings of ₹1,233-1,250 globally, K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_Indian_films">third highest-grossing Indian film of all time,</a> 
                                and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_India">second highest-grossing film in India.</a> A sequel is in development.</p>

        <h1 style="background: linear-gradient(#FF9933,white,green); color: rgb(17, 17, 17); text-align: center;"> Vallabhbhai Patel </h1><hr>

        <p style="margin-left: 550px;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Sardar_patel_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Sardar_patel_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="image of sardar patel" width="250" style="border: 3px solid black;"></p><br>

        <p style="background-color: #FF9933; color: black;">Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel ; (31 October 1875 - 15 December 1950), endeared as Sardar, was an Indian lawyer, influential political leader and statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He is also called the <span style="color: white; padding: 2px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;"> "Unifier of India" </a></span>.<span style="color: white; padding: 2px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Unity" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;"> "The Statue of Unity" </a></span>, the ruling BJP government erected world's tallest statue at a cost of USD420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height. He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation. He was one of the conservative members of the Indian National Congress. In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.</p>

        <p style="background-color: white; color:black">Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.</p>
            
        <p style="background-color: green; color: black;">As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. He led the task of forging a united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British colonial provinces that formed the Dominion of India. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet <span style="color: white; padding: 2px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;"> "Iron Man of India" </a></span>. He is also remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for having established the modern All India Services system.</p>
